# c-shell
A simplified Unix command shell with several basic functions (e.g. ls) and reads a profile file to get PATH and HOME.

shell.c = the source code

profile = the profile file

Makefile = the makefile

Compile: make

Run: ./shell

Note that shell.c, profile, and Makefile has to be in the same directory.
